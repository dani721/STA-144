### Probability

### Simple Random Sampling

A simple random sample (SRS) is the simplest form of probability sample. An
SRS of size n is taken when every possible subset of n units in the population
has the same chance of being the sample.

### Stratified Random Sampling

In a stratified random sample, the population is divided into subgroups called
strata. Then an SRS is selected from each stratum, and the SRSs in the strata
are selected independently.
